# GH60-Universal-plate
There are 4 plates in this repository
These switch plates are for GH60 standard PCBs
Tray mount support only.

It contains 2 different types.
Two of them are for standard 60% keyboard which LShift is 2.25u
  1. universal-mx-open.dxf
  2. universal-mx-square.dxf
And the other two of them are for left shift 60% which LShift is 2u
  1. leftshift mx-open.dxf
  2. leftshift mx-square.dxf
For the naming, [Open] means it you can open the switches without disordering PCB; and for [square], that means it's the normal square holes and if you wanna open the switches you have to take them all down, but it's a little bit stabler though.

The last row support following muntiple types of mounting
  1.25u*3+6.25u+1.25u*4
  1.75u+1u+1.75u+6.25u+1u*4
  1.5u+1u+1.5u+6.25u+1.25u*4
  1.5u+1u+1.5u+7u+1.5u+1u+1.25u
  1.5u+1.5u+7u+1.25u*4
  1.5u+1.5u+7u+1u*4
  1.5u+1.5u+7u+1.25u*4
And ISO Enter supported
