# GH60-Universal-plate
There are 4 plates in this repository
These switch plates are for GH60 standard PCBs
Tray mount support only.

It contains 2 different types.
Two of them are for standard 60% keyboard which LShift is 2.25u
  1. universal-mx-open.dxf
  2. universal-mx-square.dxf
And the other two of them are for left shift 60% which LShift is 2u
  1. leftshift mx-open.dxf
  2. leftshift mx-square.dxf
For the naming, [Open] means it you can open the switches without disordering PCB; and for [square], that means it's the normal square holes and if you wanna open the switches you have to take them all down, but it's a little bit stabler though.

Only PCB mount stablizer are compiled due to the universal layout design.
You can use these switch plates to create your own keyboard or whatever you want. 
Download and give them to factory and CNC, that simple.

Enjoy!
